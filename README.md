Probelm statement: CBP18 Real time vehicle tracking system
The probelm statement of this project is when a person is waiting at a bus stop they are unaware about their bus' location or its time of arrival.
And while in the bus they need help in prediction of time to be taken to reach the destination.
Another point is in Himachal Pradesh there is a lot of hilly areas that are prone to landslides and avalanches so, the motive is to highlight the safest route accordingly to help prevent any damage.

The purpose of the application is to provide details to the user of public transportation.
It will have following features
Display ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival)
Display real-time bus location
Display next bus arrival time
Display next bus arrival time

Instruction for users
